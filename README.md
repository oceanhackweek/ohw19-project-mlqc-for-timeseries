## Local Python Environment
I have added an **environment.yaml** file into the repository which will allow you to setup a local python environment with some standardized python packages using the follow command:

      conda env create -f environment.yaml

This will allow anyone in the future to setup their computer to run our packages in an uniform computing environment.
